# Roll Ball Game #

I followed the Roll Ball Unity Tutorial and made the following modifications:

1. **Added Texture to the Floor:** Enhanced the visual appeal of the game by incorporating textures onto the floor.

2. **Added Sound Effect for Item Pickup:** Introduced a sound effect to enhance user experience when picking up items.

3. **Gameplay Mechanic Change:** I implemented a time limit where players must collect the cubes within 1 minute. Failure to do so results in a "You Lose" message. Additionally, adjusted the game mechanics so that points cannot be accumulated after losing.
